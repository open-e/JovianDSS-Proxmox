## Configuring

All JovianDSS Proxmox plugin configurations are stored in `/etc/pve/storage.cfg` file.

Data storage's get introduced to Proxmox VE and become available to user by defining them as `storage pool` records in `storage.cfg` file.
`storage pool` record instructs Proxmox VE to initialize driver with name provided as `type` with configurations provided as 'properties' and make it available to user over UI, REST and CLI under the name `STORAGE_ID`.
Each `storage pool` has form:

```
<type>: <STORAGE_ID>
        <property> <value>
        <property> <value>
        <property>
        ...
```

`type` is a name of a storage plugin

`STORAGE_ID` is a name of

`property` is a property name

### Proxmox config

This config provides brief introduce Open-E JovianDSS plugin to proxmox storage sub-system.
And contains minimal set of information required by perl part to run.

### Multiple Pools

Plugin allows proxmox use multiple joviandss `Pool` at a same time.
To introduce new `Pool` to proxmox user have to duplicate storage section in `storage.cfg`.

Make sure that variables `pool_name`, `path` and `content_volume_name` are different.
Here is an example of presenting 2 pools `Pool-0` and `Pool-1` to `Proxmox` as 2 independent storage's `jdss-Pool-0` and `jdss-Pool-1` using `joviandss` plugin.


And here is 2 `config` files referenced in `storage.cfg` file above:

```
joviandss: jdss-Pool-0
        pool_name Pool-0
        content images,rootdir
        debug 0
        multipath 0
        path /mnt/pve/jdss-Pool-0
        shared 1
        disable 0
        target_prefix iqn.2025-06.proxmox.pool-0
        user_name admin
        user_password admin
        ssl_cert_verify 0
        control_addresses 192.168.20.100
        control_port 82
        data_addresses 192.168.40.100
        data_port 3260
        thin_provisioning 1
        block_size 32K
        log_file /var/log/joviandss/joviandss.pool-0.log

joviandss: jdss-Pool-1
        pool_name Pool-1
        content images,rootdir
        debug 0
        multipath 0
        path /mnt/pve/jdss-Pool-1
        shared 1
        disable 0
        target_prefix iqn.2025-06.proxmox.pool-1
        user_name admin
        user_password admin
        ssl_cert_verify 0
        control_addresses 192.168.21.100
        control_port 82
        data_addresses 192.168.41.100
        data_port 3260
        thin_provisioning 1
        block_size 32K
        log_file /var/log/joviandss/joviandss.pool-1.log
```




## Multipathing

In order to enable multipathing user should provide a set of modifications to `storage.cfg` and `multipath.conf`

For instance if user wants to enable multipathing on for storage `jdss-Pool-0` described in config files as:


`/etc/pve/storage.cfg`
```
joviandss: jdss-Pool-0
        pool_name Pool-0
        content images,rootdir
        debug 0
        multipath 0
        path /mnt/pve/jdss-Pool-0-lvm
        shared 1
        disable 0
        target_prefix iqn.2025-06.proxmox.pool-0
        user_name admin
        user_password admin
        ssl_cert_verify 0
        control_addresses 192.168.20.100
        control_port 82
        data_addresses 192.168.40.100
        data_port 3260
        thin_provisioning 1
        block_size 32K
        log_file /var/log/joviandss/joviandss.log
```


He should apply following changes:

### storage.cfg

Set `multipath` option to `1` and expand data addresses with additional pathways.
In the example below we expand original `data_addresses 192.168.40.100` with VIP `192.168.50.100`

`/etc/pve/storage.cfg`
```
joviandss: jdss-Pool-0
        pool_name Pool-0
        content images,rootdir
        debug 0
        multipath 1
        path /mnt/pve/jdss-Pool-0-lvm
        shared 1
        disable 0
        target_prefix iqn.2025-06.proxmox.pool-0
        user_name admin
        user_password admin
        ssl_cert_verify 0
        control_addresses 192.168.20.100,192.168.30.100
        control_port 82
        data_addresses 192.168.40.100,192.168.50.100
        data_port 3260
        thin_provisioning 1
        block_size 32K
        log_file /var/log/joviandss/joviandss.log
```



### multipath.conf

Make sure that multipath service is present 

```bash
apt install multipath-tools sg3-utils
```
Make sure that multipath service is running:
```bash
systemctl enable multipathd
systemctl start multipathd
systemctl status multipathd
```
Starting with version 0.9.7, the plugin uses the SCSI ID wwid to serve multipath volumes. Because of this, users should avoid blacklisting by wwid:

```
blacklist {
        wwid .*
}
```
The user must check their configuration and ensure that such a line is NOT present. If it is, it must be removed to allow the plugin to work properly with multipath volumes.

Also to avoid unnecessary volumes to be managed by multipath, it is recommended to `blacklist` by vendor. If user choose to do so, he also have to set exception for JovianDSS volumes.
Example of multipath blacklist and blacklist exception is provided below.

```
blacklist {
    device {
        vendor ".*"
    }
}

blacklist_exceptions {
    device {
        vendor "SCST_BIO"
    }
}
```




## Installing/Uninstalling

### Install from source 

Installation can be done by `make` inside source code folder

```bash
apt install python3-oslo.utils git
git clone https://github.com/open-e/JovianDSS-Proxmox.git
cd ./JovianDSS-Proxmox
make install
```

Removing proxmox plugin with `jdssc`
```bash
make uninstall

### Installation for `deb` package
Or by installing it from debian package

```bash
apt install ./open-e-joviandss-proxmox-plugin_0.10.0.deb
```

After installation  restart the Proxmox service.
